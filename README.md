## Progress
The frontends development has basically just started and barely anything has been made. Here is a list of all endpoints + features and if they've been made or not.
- [x] Authentication
- [ ] Navbar

- [ ] Search
- [ ] Beatmap page
- [ ] Profile page
- [ ] Clan leaderboard
- [ ] Clan page
